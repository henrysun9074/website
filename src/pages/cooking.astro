    <h1>Cooking</h1>
    <p>I mostly make Chinese food. I'm going to put my biggest successes and fails on here sometime later :D.
        For making Chinese food I don't think I've ever really followed a recipe. I trust in my ancestors and Chef Wang Gang's YouTube tutorials.
        So no recipes on this website -- just photos and vibes. Here, have a photo of some 白菜豆腐
        and US politics. A great combination.
