### Project Overview

Sympatric speciation refers to the diversification of two lineages into two genetically distinct species while both species still occupy the same geographic region. This process could potentially be ongoing in blue crabs, which have been observed to separate by salinity in estuaries (<a href="https://journals.bilpubgroup.com/index.php/jfs/article/view/2438">Moran et al. 2020</a>). If low- and high-salinity blue crab genotypes were genetically distinct, then sympatric speciation could be ongoing. 

Dr. Dan has managed to collect blue crabs from a variety of low- and high- salinity environments, including Beaufort, Lake Mattamuskeet, the Chesapeake Bay, and Turkey. After CO1 barcoding of these samples, a median-joining haplotype network was generated which provides a high-level overview of genetic differences between crab populations. Below is a poster summarizing past work done in the lab on this topic.

<h4>It was found that 4x as many high salinity crabs were haplotype H3!!</h4>

### Current Progress

<p class="project-description"> I started this project while I was working on CO1 barcoding and sequencing of oysters from the Duke Aquafarm to identify local species which were settling on farmed <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>. Given the lab work for Dr. Dan's research here was very similar, I got involved and started by extracting DNA from 7 new Sardinian blue crab samples. Similar to prior crab extractions, I took tissue from one walking leg and extracted DNA using the Wizard SV Genomic purification system. Then, I used CO1 primers to amplify a portion of the CO1 gene, purified the PCR products, and performed the sequencing on a Nanopore (GridION). 

After sequencing, I generated consensus sequences for the CO1 gene for these 7 individuals. The GitHub link provided at the top of this page contains both the code to build consensus sequences in FASTA format as well as the raw .fastq sequence data for the crabs. Next steps (I plan to continue with bioinformatic analysis throughout the 2024-2025 school year) will include alignment of these sequences to preexisting haplotypes from blue crabs sampled from habitats of various salinities. This will provide a more complete picture of whether blue crabs segregate by salinity, and if so, how this could be contributing to ongoing speciation.</p>
